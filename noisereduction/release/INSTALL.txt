Noise Reduction
===============

* Install REAPER (any version) (http://www.reaper.fm/download.php)
* Install the vst plugin "volpedal1" for your platform
    * OSX: VST plugins go to /Library/Audio/Plugins/VST
    * linux: ~/.vst 
* Copy the REAPER session (the file ending in .RPP) to a folder of your choice. 

This vst allows to control the dynamics via an expression pedal after noise reduction,
thus preserving the noise profile.
